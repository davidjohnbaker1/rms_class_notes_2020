* It's hard to imagine any treatment that has a non-zero effect
* Don't need data for non-zero effect
* Bayes gives you way to play odds
* Grabbing umbrella in morning is playing odds, not about conclude it will rain 
* Can take an action on the basis of a probablity without making a conclusion with bayes 
* Hypothesis testing has to go, never did what we wanted it to 
* Low medium and high never good for anything (person with stopwatch, speedometer)
* You'd pretend there is agreement if you thought there were cutoffs
* Poker as probabilitic reasoning is way to go, gotta put money on the line 
* Risk score assumes we don't have computers
* Don't call it risk score, call it risk 
* We want life expectancy calculators
* If don't want life expectnacy, talk about time 
* Whole risk score is less predictive

* Using a model with admission of guilt is a good idea, better than not 
* Worst of all words is a black box that doesnt perform well and uninterpreatble
* Often you are mislead if logistic vs neural network 
* Poor calibration overrides problem in c index 
* Need to have calibration curve 

* Prefered Nutshell
* Decide how many df can be spent
* Decide where to spend them 
* Spend
* Never recorder, especially if inference 

* The Cost of Data Analysis -- horror story of data analysis
* BBR notes has lots of stuff on propensity comparison 

* g index instead of standard deviation 

## The Bootstrap 

* If not bayesian, should be using bootstrap like once a week
* 1977/6 Effron for statistics 
* If know population model with no distribution that generates data?
fraction of observations less than or equal to current point?

* ! See bootstrap in notes 
Pretend population is empricical
sampling from empricial is same as sampling with replacement to observed 

* Read [62] on bootstrapp confidence intervals and which one to choose 
* FH says bootsrap variale for model vlidation, not bootstrap 

* Bootsrap estimates bias 
* estimating optimism, bias due to overfiitting

* BBR talks about what it means to validate a model 
* Interal validation can tell you it doesnt work much faster

* Gotta validate people, not models?
* Potti scandel at Duke
* DV reversed
* Columns off
